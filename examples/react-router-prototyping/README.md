# React Router setup

## How to use

Download the example or [clone the repo](http://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp):

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 react-sketchapp-master/examples/react-router-prototyping
cd react-router-prototyping
```

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then, open Sketch and navigate to `Plugins â†’ react-sketchapp: React Router prototyping`

Run with live reloading in Sketch, need a new sketch doc open

```bash
npm run render
```

## The idea behind the example

`react-sketchapp` allows you to build prototypes with navigation. This example shows how you build a Sketch prototype with `react-sketchapp-router`, while being able to share your routing code with your React web or React Native app.
