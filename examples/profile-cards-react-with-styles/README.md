# Profile Cards w/ react-with-styles

## How to use

Download the example or [clone the repo](http://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp):

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 react-sketchapp-master/examples/profile-cards-react-with-styles
cd profile-cards-react-with-styles
```

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then, open Sketch and navigate to `Plugins → react-sketchapp: Profile Cards`

Run with live reloading in Sketch

```bash
npm run render
```

## The idea behind the example

Use `react-sketchapp` with [`react-with-styles`](https://github.com/airbnb/react-with-styles) — a library for writing CSS-in-JS without coupling to specific implementations.
