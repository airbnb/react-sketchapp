  <strong>render React components to Sketch; tailor-made for design systems</strong>
</div>

## Quick-start 🏃‍

First, make sure you have installed [Sketch](http://sketchapp.com) version 43+, & a recent [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Open a new Sketch file, then in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp.git
cd react-sketchapp/examples/basic-setup && npm install

npm run render
```

Next, [check out some more examples](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp/tree/master/examples)!

## Why?!

Managing the assets of design systems in Sketch is complex, error-prone and time consuming. Sketch is scriptable, but the API often changes. React provides the perfect wrapper to build reusable documents in a way already familiar to JavaScript developers.

## What does the code look like?

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { render, Text, Artboard } from 'react-sketchapp';

const App = props => (
  <Artboard>
    <Text style={{ fontFamily: 'Comic Sans MS', color: 'hotPink' }}>{props.message}</Text>
  </Artboard>
);

export default context => {
  render(<App message="Hello world!" />, context.document.currentPage());
};
```

## What can I do with it?

- **Manage design systems—** `react-sketchapp` was built for [Airbnb’s design system](http://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/); this is the easiest way to manage Sketch assets in a large design system
- **Use real components for designs—** Implement your designs in code as React components and render them into Sketch
- **Design with real data—** Designing with data is important but challenging; `react-sketchapp` makes it simple to fetch and incorporate real data into your Sketch files
- **Build new tools on top of Sketch—** the easiest way to use Sketch as a canvas for custom design tooling

Found a novel use? We'd love to hear about it!
