## Version 2.0.0

- Now throws if the "Symbols" page is explicitly passed in as the `container` on the `render` method. Previously if you explicitly passed in the "Symbols" pages as a container, it would create a new page and render onto that. (#297 - Thanks @jaridmargolin!)

- Adds support for rendering a `Page` component into a container passed through the `render` method. This allows for rendering multiple `Artboard`s onto an existing page. (#297 - Thanks @jaridmargolin!)
